// Full-database export/import — protects against data loss (see build
// brief follow-up: "a full usable product" needs a recovery path beyond
// Cloudflare D1's own time-travel, and the local Express+SQLite deploy has
// no platform-level safety net at all). Deliberately DB-rows only, not
// photo/scan binaries — those live on disk (local) or R2 (Worker) and are
// a separate concern; a restore repopulates every bird/pedigree/folder
// record correctly, but a photoUrl pointing at a file that's genuinely
// gone stays a broken image rather than being silently dropped.
//
// The Anthropic API key is deliberately EXCLUDED from the export — a
// backup file is something you might hand off, store in a cloud drive, or
// keep for years; a live secret has no business riding along in it.
